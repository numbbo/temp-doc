## Explanation 

<div id="text-directions-searchspace" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Pareto set approximation

This plot shows the projection of the Pareto set approximation (in black) and some 1-dimensional cuts (in various colors, see below) onto an axes-parallel cut of the search space defined by two variables ($x_1$ and $x_4$). 
</div>

<div id="text-directions-searchspace-projection" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Pareto set approximation (optima direction)

This plot contains the projection of the Pareto set approximation and some 1-dimensional cuts (in various colors, see below) onto a random cutting plane that contains both single-objective optima. It additionally shows the contour lines for each objective function.
</div>

<div id="text-directions-objspace" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Pareto front approximation (original space)

This plot depicts the Pareto front approximation and the results of some 1-dimensional cuts (in various colors, see below) in the original scaling of the objective space (as seen by an optimization algorithm).
</div>

<div id="text-directions-logobjspace" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Pareto front approximation (normalized space)

This plot depicts the Pareto front approximation and the results of some 1-dimensional cuts (in various colors, see below) in the normalized objective space (in log scale), where the ideal point is at (0, 0) and the nadir point is at (1, 1).
</div>

<div id="text-additional-info" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
In addition to the best known Pareto set/front approximation, the plots present **1-dimensional cuts** ("lines") through the search space:
- along a random direction through each single-objective optimum (in blue),
- along each coordinate axis through each single-objective optimum (blue dotted lines),
- along the line connecting both single-objective optima (in red),
- two fully random lines (in yellow), and
- a random line in the random projection plane going through both optima (in green).

All straight lines are of the same length (10) with the support vector in its exact middle. Ticks along the lines indicate line segments of the same length in search space. Thicker points on the lines depict solutions that are non-dominated with respect to all points on the same line.

Furthermore, the Pareto set approximation plots highlight the projected region $[-5,5]^n$ as a gray-shaded area while the gray-shaded area in the Pareto front approximation plots denotes the region of interest between the ideal ($\times$) and nadir points ($+$). 
</div>

<div id="text-dominance-ratio" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Dominance ratio

Based on a $501\times501$ grid in the search space, the dominance ratio of each grid point is the ratio of all grid points that dominate it (Fonseca, 1995, p. 71ff.). The plot uses a logarithmic color scale with the overall non-dominated points shown in yellow.
</div>

<div id="text-level-sets" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Level sets

This plot shows the level sets for each objective (first objective in blue, second objective in red) together with the non-dominated points of the $501\times501$ grid.
</div>

<div id="text-local-dominance" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Local dominance

This plot by Fieldsend et al. (2019) uses, for each point of the $501\times501$ grid, one of three different colors. In dark green, it shows all grid points $P$ for which *all* 8 neighboring grid points (in the Moore neighborhood) are mutually non-dominated to $P$. In landscape analysis terms, we can call the green regions in the plots "dominance-neutral local optima regions" in the sense that a dominance-based hill-climber will be able to explore a green region by single non-dominated moves. The pink areas are comprised of grid points for which *at least one* neighboring grid point dominates it. Each pink area is considered a "basin of attraction" of a green area in the sense that a local dominance-based hill climber can only move towards the included green area. Last, a grid point is assigned a white color if at least two of its dominating neighbors belong to two different basins of attraction&mdash;white areas in the plots therefore show the boundaries between the basins.
</div>

<div id="text-gradient-length" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Gradient length

This plot shows the length of the normalized multiobjective gradient at each of $501\times501$ grid points, computed as 

$\frac{\nabla f_1(x)}{|\nabla f_1(x)|} + \frac{\nabla f_2(x)}{|\nabla f_2(x)|}
  = \sqrt{1 + \cos\left(\theta \right)}\times\sqrt{2}$

where $\nabla f_1(x)$ and $\nabla f_2(x)$ are the gradients of the objectives $f_1$ and $f_2$ in a search point $x$ and $\theta$ is the angle between these gradients. The normalized multiobjective gradient is exactly zero for Pareto-optimal solutions as well as locally non-dominated solutions. 
</div>

<div id="text-path-length" markdown="1" style="padding-top: 10px;">
### Path length

This plot shows the length of the path from each of $501\times501$ grid points towards the next local optimum. Inspired by the cumulated gradient field landscapes (Kerschke and Grimme, 2017), the length is defined as Euclidean distance to the Moore neighbor to which the biobjective gradient points plus the path length of this neighbor. Cumulated gradient field landscapes sum gradient lengths instead of Euclidean distances. We use the latter because they better quantify the actual distance to the local optimum, however both approaches lead to qualitatively very similar figures.

 <a name="F1"></a>F<sub>1</sub>: Sphere/Sphere 
Combination of two sphere functions ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto
front is convex. Furthermore, the normalized hypervolume value of the
entire Pareto front with respect to the nadir point as reference point
can be computed analytically as the integral
$1-\int_{0}^{1} (1-\sqrt{x})^2dx = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{4}{3}=0.833333\ldots$.

Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.
Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f2" markdown="1">
 <a name="F2"></a>F<sub>2</sub>: Sphere/Ellipsoid separable 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the separable ellipsoid function ([f<sub>2</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=10) in the bbob suite).

Both objectives are unimodal and separable. While the first objective is
truly convex-quadratic with a condition number of 1, the second
objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about $10^6$.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f3" markdown="1">
 <a name="F3"></a>F<sub>3</sub>: Sphere/Attractive sector 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the attractive sector function ([f<sub>6</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=30) in the bbob suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly $(1/2)^n$
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f4" markdown="1">
 <a name="F4"></a>F<sub>4</sub>: Sphere/Rosenbrock original 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the original, i.e., unrotated Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>8</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=40) in the bbob suite).

The first objective is separable and truly convex, the second
objective is partially separable (tri-band structure). The first
objective is unimodal while the second objective has a local
optimum with an attraction volume of about 25%.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f5" markdown="1">
 <a name="F5"></a>F<sub>5</sub>: Sphere/Sharp ridge 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the sharp ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=65) in the bbob suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the ridge needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f6" markdown="1">
 <a name="F6"></a>F<sub>6</sub>: Sphere/Sum of Different Powers 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the sum of different powers function ([f<sub>14</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=70) in the bbob suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal. The first objective is
separable, the second non-separable.
When approaching the second objective's optimum, the difference
in sensitivity between different directions in search space
increases unboundedly.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f7" markdown="1">
 <a name="F7"></a>F<sub>7</sub>: Sphere/Rastrigin 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the Rastrigin function ([f<sub>15</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=75) in the bbob suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separability,
multimodality (roughly $10^n$ local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

Contained in the *separable - multimodal* function group.

</div>

<div id="text-f8" markdown="1">
 <a name="F8"></a>F<sub>8</sub>: Sphere/Schaffer F7, condition 10 
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the bbob suite)
and the Schaffer F7 function with condition number 10 ([f<sub>17</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=85) in the bbob suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, an asymmetric, non-separable,
and highly multimodal function needs to be solved to approach the Pareto
front/Pareto set where the frequency and amplitude of the modulation
in the second objective vary. The conditioning of the second objective
and thus the entire bi-objective function is low.

Contained in the *separable - multimodal* function group.

and the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=100) in the bbob suite).

While the first objective function is separable and unimodal,
the second objective function is partially separable and highly
multimodal---having the most prominent $2^n$ minima located
comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area.

Contained in the *separable - weakly-structured* function group.

and the Gallagher function with 101 peaks ([f<sub>21</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=105) in the bbob suite).

While the first objective function is separable and unimodal,
the second objective function is non-separable and consists
of 101 optima with position and height being unrelated and
randomly chosen (different for each instantiation of the function).
The conditioning around the global optimum of the second
objective function is about 30.

Both objectives are unimodal, separable, only globally
quadratic with smooth local irregularities, and highly

about $10^6$.

Besides being both separable, the two objective functions are quite opposite:
the first objective function is unimodal, globally quadratic and ill-conditioned
with a conditioning of about $10^6$ with smooth local irregularities while
the second objective function is highly multimodal with roughly $10n$ local
optima and only small conditioning of about $10$. Note that the separable

 <a name="F88"></a>F<sub>88</sub>: Gallagher 101/Katsuuras 
Combination of Gallagher’s Gaussian 101-me Peaks function ([f<sub>21</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=105) in the bbob suite) and the
Katsuuras function ([f<sub>23</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=115) in the bbob suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal with
only a weak global structure. Gallagher's Gaussian 101-me Peaks
function consists of a set of 101 optima with position and height being
unrelated and randomly chosen. The conditioning is about 30.
The Katsuuras function, in turn, is highly repetitive with more than $10^n$
global optima.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.

Combination of Gallagher’s Gaussian 101-me Peaks function ([f<sub>21</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=105) in the bbob suite) and the
Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function ([f<sub>24</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=120) in the bbob suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal with
only a weak global structure. Gallagher's Gaussian 101-me Peaks
function consists of a set of 101 optima with position and height being
unrelated and randomly chosen. The conditioning is about 30.
The Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function has two superimposed funnels. Presumably,
different approaches need to be used for 'selecting the funnel'
and for searching the highly multimodal function 'within' the funnel.
The single-objective Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function was constructed
to be deceptive for some evolutionary algorithms with large population size.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.
