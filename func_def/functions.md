### F<sub>1</sub>: Sphere/Sphere
Combination of two sphere functions ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto
front is convex. Furthermore, the normalized hypervolume value of the
entire Pareto front with respect to the nadir point as reference point
can be computed analytically as the integral
$1-\int_{0}^{1} (1-\sqrt{x})^2dx = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{4}{3}=0.833333\ldots$.

Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.
Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.



### F<sub>2</sub>: Sphere/Ellipsoid separable
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the separable ellipsoid function ([f<sub>2</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=10) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objectives are unimodal and separable. While the first objective is
truly convex-quadratic with a condition number of 1, the second
objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about $10^6$.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function group.


### F<sub>3</sub>: Sphere/Attractive sector
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the attractive sector function ([f<sub>6</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=30) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly $(1/2)^n$
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.



### F<sub>4</sub>: Sphere/Rosenbrock original
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the original, i.e., unrotated Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>8</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=40) in the `bbob` suite).

The first objective is separable and truly convex, the second
objective is partially separable (tri-band structure). The first
objective is unimodal while the second objective has a local
optimum with an attraction volume of about 25%.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function group.



### F<sub>5</sub>: Sphere/Sharp ridge
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the sharp ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=65) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the ridge needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>6</sub>: Sphere/Sum of Different Powers
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)

Both objective functions are unimodal. The first objective is
separable, the second non-separable.

in sensitivity between different directions in search space
increases unboundedly.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>7</sub>: Sphere/Rastrigin

and the Rastrigin function ([f<sub>15</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=75) in the `bbob` suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separability,
multimodality (roughly $10^n$ local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

Contained in the *separable - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>8</sub>: Sphere/Schaffer F7, condition 10
Combination of the sphere function ([f<sub>1</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=5) in the `bbob` suite)
and the Schaffer F7 function with condition number 10 ([f<sub>17</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=85) in the `bbob` suite).

In addition to the simple sphere function, an asymmetric, non-separable,
and highly multimodal function needs to be solved to approach the Pareto
front/Pareto set where the frequency and amplitude of the modulation
in the second objective vary. The conditioning of the second objective
and thus the entire bi-objective function is low.

comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area.

the first objective function is unimodal, globally quadratic and ill-conditioned
with a conditioning of about $10^6$ with smooth local irregularities while
the second objective function is highly multimodal with roughly $10n$ local
optima and only small conditioning of about $10$. Note that the separable

placement of the optima but asymmetric and oscillating non-linear transformations
of this function alleviates the symmetry and regularity of the original Rastrigin function.

so-called banana function (due to its 2-D contour lines as a bent ridge or valley) and
in larger dimensions, has a local optimum with an attraction volume of about 25%.

This function resembles $F_{67}$ except for the additional search space
rotation for the second objective function which makes both objective

Both objective functions are globally quadratic (unimodal) ill-conditioned functions with
condition numbers of $10^6$ with  smooth local irregularities. A single direction
in search space is a thousand times more sensitive than all others for the Discus function.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>71</sub>: Ellipsoid/Bent Cigar
Combination of the Ellipsoid function ([f<sub>10</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=50) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Bent Cigar function ([f<sub>12</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=60) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$. The Ellipsoid function is globally quadratic with
smooth local irregularities while the Bent Cigar function deviates remarkably
from being quadratic due to an asymmetric transformation. To optimize the
Bent Cigar function, a smooth, but very narrow ridge has to be followed.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>72</sub>: Ellipsoid/Sharp Ridge
Combination of the Ellipsoid function ([f<sub>10</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=50) in the `bbob` suite) and the

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$. Compared to the previous function, the ridge of the
here is sharp (non-differentiable) and the gradient remains constant, when the
ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose
close to the ridge because the gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Both objective functions are unimodal and non-separable. While the
Ellipsoid function has a constant conditioning of $10^6$ everywhere,
the sensitivities of the $z_i$-variables (in the rotated search space)
for the Different Powers function become more and more different when
approaching the optimum. The latter function has furthermore a small
solution volume.

of about $10^6$.
The Discus function is globally quadratic with smooth local irregularities
and has a single direction in search space that is a thousand times more
sensitive than all others. The Bent Cigar function deviates remarkably

Combination of the Discus function ([f<sub>11</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=55) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Sharp Ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=65) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$.
The Discus function is globally quadratic with smooth local irregularities
and has a single direction in search space that is a thousand times more
sensitive than all others.
To optimize the Sharp Ridge function, a sharp (i.e. non-differentiable) ridge
has to be followed around which the gradient remains constant, when the
ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose
close to the ridge because the gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>76</sub>: Discus/Sum of Different Powers
Combination of the Discus function ([f<sub>11</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=55) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Sum of Different Powers function ([f<sub>14</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=70) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal and non-separable. While the
globally quadratic Discus function has a constant conditioning
of about $10^6$ everywhere
with a single direction in search space that is a thousand times more
sensitive than all others, the sensitivities of the
$z_i$-variables (in the rotated search space)
for the Different Powers function become more and more different when
approaching the optimum. The latter function has furthermore a small
solution volume.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>77</sub>: Bent Cigar/Sharp Ridge
Combination of the Bent Cigar function ([f<sub>12</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=60) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Sharp Ridge function ([f<sub>13</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=65) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$.
The Bent Cigar function deviates remarkably
from being quadratic due to an asymmetric transformation and a smooth,
but very narrow ridge has to be followed to optimize it.
To optimize the Sharp Ridge function, in turn, the ridge to be followed
is even sharper (i.e. non-differentiable), around which the gradient remains
constant, when the ridge is approached from a given point. Approaching the ridge is
initially effective, but search behavior becomes difficult to diagnose
close to the ridge because the gradient towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>78</sub>: Bent Cigar/Sum of Different Powers
Combination of the Bent Cigar function ([f<sub>12</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=60) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Sum of Different Powers function ([f<sub>14</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=70) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are unimodal, non-separable, and have a conditioning
of about $10^6$.

Both objective functions are unimodal and non-separable but differ in the
difficulties provided to an optimization algorithm.
The Bent Cigar function, on the one hand, deviates remarkably
from being quadratic due to an asymmetric transformation and a smooth,
but very narrow ridge has to be followed to optimize it.
The sensitivities of the
$z_i$-variables (in the rotated search space)
for the Different Powers function, on the other hand,
become more and more different when
approaching the optimum.

Contained in the *ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned* function group.



### F<sub>79</sub>: Rastrigin/Schaffer F7 with conditioning of 1000
Combination of the Rastrigin function ([f<sub>15</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=75) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Schaffer F7 function with conditioning 1000 ([f<sub>18</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=90) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal.
The problem's Rastrigin function alleviates the symmetry and regularity of
the originally proposed Rastrigin function via asymmetric and oscillating
transformations of the search space. It has roughly $10^n$ local optima,
a low conditioning, and the global amplitude of function values is large
compared to the local amplitudes.
On the contrary, frequency  and  amplitude  of  the  function value modulation
vary for the Schaffer F7 function. It is furthermore asymmetric as well
but, compared to the other objective function is moderately ill-conditioned
with a conditioning of 1000.

Contained in the *multimodal - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>80</sub>: Rastrigin/Griewank-Rosenbrock
Combination of the Rastrigin function ([f<sub>15</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=75) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Griewank-Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>19</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=95) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal.
Both objective functions furthermore are variants of the original Rosenbrock
function:
The problem's Rastrigin function alleviates the symmetry and regularity of
the originally proposed Rastrigin function via asymmetric and oscillating
transformations of the search space. The Griewank-Rosenbrock function
resembles the original Rosenbrock function in a highly multimodal way.

Contained in the *multimodal multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>81</sub>: Schaffer F7/Schaffer F7 with conditioning 1000
Combination of the Schaffer F7 function ([f<sub>17</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=85) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Schaffer F7 with conditioning 1000 function ([f<sub>18</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=90) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are of the same type (asymmetric, non-separable,
highly multimodal where frequency and amplitude of the modulation vary).
The main difference is in the conditioning, which is about 10 in one case
and 1000 in the other.

Contained in the *multimodal - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>82</sub>: Schaffer F7/Griewank-Rosenbrock
Combination of the Schaffer F7 function ([f<sub>17</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=85) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Griewank-Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>19</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=95) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are non-separable and highly multimodal.
For the asymmetric Schaffer F7 function, frequency and amplitude of
the function value modulation vary and it has a low conditioning of
about 10. The Griewank-Rosenbrock function
resembles the original Rosenbrock function in a highly multimodal way.

Contained in the *multimodal - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>83</sub>: Schaffer F7 with conditioning 1000/Griewank-Rosenbrock
Combination of the Schaffer F7 function with conditioning 1000 ([f<sub>18</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=90) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Griewank-Rosenbrock function ([f<sub>19</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=95) in the `bbob` suite).

Compared to $F_{82}$, the only difference is the higher condition number of
about 1000 (compared to 10) in the Schaffer F7 function.

Contained in the *multimodal - multimodal* function group.



### F<sub>84</sub>: Schwefel/Gallagher 21
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=100) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Gallagher 21 function ([f<sub>22</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=110) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are multimodal with only a weak global structure.
The most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of
the unpenalized search area. The penalization is essential, as otherwise more
and better minima occur further away from the search space origin. The function
is furthermore partially separable, a kind of combinatorial problem, and has two
search regimes. The Gallagher function consists of 21 optima with position and
height being unrelated and randomly chosen (different for each instantiation
of the function). The conditioning of the Gallagher function around the global
optimum is about 1000.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>85</sub>: Schwefel/Katsuuras
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=100) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Katsuuras function ([f<sub>23</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=115) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are highly multimodal with an exponential number
(in the dimension) of (global) optima and only a weak global structure.
The most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of
the unpenalized search area.
The Katsuuras function, in turn, is highly repetitive with more than $10^n$
global optima.



### F<sub>86</sub>: Schwefel/Lunacek bi-Rastrigin
Combination of the Schwefel function ([f<sub>20</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=100) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function ([f<sub>24</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=120) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are highly multimodal with only a weak global structure.
While the most prominent $2^n$ minima of the Schwefel function
are located comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area,
the Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function has two superimposed funnels. Presumably,
different approaches need to be used for 'selecting the funnel'
and for searching the highly multimodal function 'within' the funnel.
The single-objective Lunacek bi-Rastrigin function was constructed
to be deceptive for some evolutionary algorithms with large population size.

Contained in the *weakly-structure - weakly-structured* function group.



### F<sub>87</sub>: Gallagher 101/Gallagher 21
Combination of Gallagher’s Gaussian 101-me Peaks function ([f<sub>21</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=105) in the `bbob` suite) and the
Gallagher’s Gaussian 21-hi Peaks function ([f<sub>22</sub>](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf#page=110) in the `bbob` suite).

Both objective functions are multimodal and non-separable. Both consist of a set of
optima with position and height being unrelated and randomly chosen. The number of
optima is 101 and 21 respectively and the condition number around the (unique) global
optima are about 30 and about 1000 respectively.

Contained in the *weakly-structured - weakly-structured* function group.
