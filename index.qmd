Welcome to the website with supplementary material for the bbob-biobj and bbob-biobj-ext test suites from the [COCO](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) (Comparing Continuous Optimizers) platform. 

It provides [function definitions](def.qmd) and [visualizations](vis.qmd) for all 92 bbob-biobj-ext problems introduced in the paper <strong>Using Well-Understood Single-Objective Functions in Multiobjective Black-Box Optimization Test Suites</strong> by   Dimo Brockhoff, Anne Auger, Nikolaus Hansen and Tea Tu≈°ar submitted to <cite>Evolutionary Computation Journal</cite>. It also shows the [empirical distribution of angles](ecdfs.qmd) between the two (estimated) gradients at the best known Pareto set approximations in low dimensions. The [postprossed data page](ppdata.qmd) shows the postprocessed results from a comparison among three selected algorithms.
